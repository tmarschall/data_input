This project provides a set of classes which simplify some of the repetitive tasks of reading data files in c++.  The classes are DatFileInput for space separated data files, GzFileInput for similar data files which have been compressed with gzip, and BinFileInput

The example shows the basic functions for the class DatFileInput, such as getting numbers from the header and getting columns.  See file_input.h for all member functions.

The example program and library (libdatainput.a) can be compiled using the make command.  The library should be put somewhere visible to the compiler.
